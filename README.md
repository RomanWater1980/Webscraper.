# Webscraper.
Simple Webscaper build in Python. I'm not responsible if you use this to do anything illegal with this, I also don't advise you to. This is made for legal purposes.
Requires bs4. You can install bs4 by going to the Command Prompt in Windows, as an administatrator(haven't tested pip install on non administrator CMD so for result matching mine use admistrator) type "pip install bs4" without the speech marks.
